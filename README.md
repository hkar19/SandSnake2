# SandSnake2
This is a classic snake game.
the snake and foods are drawn as grids.

when the snake eats food, the snake will have longer tails.
when the snake pass the boundaries, the snake will reappear on the other side of boundaries.
when the snake bites its own tail, it will turn red and dead.

the foods will appear at a random place within the boundaries.
